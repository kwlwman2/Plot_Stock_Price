# Plot_Stock_Price
To plot stock price

Hello everyone, this is my first project, which is to plot different prices of stock on the same chart so that we can compare how are selected stocks going over time. 

This is just my first project after 3-month study of Python, anything things like problems, good suggestions and cool ideas, please feel free to let me know!

Thank you so much for your help !
